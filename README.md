Open "Car Price Predictor.py" and run through any IDE. ProjectNotebook.ipynb shows how the exported model (RF_model.joblib) and encoder (encoder.pkl) were created, along with other analytical information of the .csv datasets ("Sport car price.csv" inclusion was ommitted).

Ready for build through libraries such as PyInstaller.
